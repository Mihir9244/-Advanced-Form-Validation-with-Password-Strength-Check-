# Advanced Form Validation with Password Strength Check 

# Advanced Web Form with Real-Time Validation

This repository presents a web-based form with advanced validation features designed to ensure the accuracy and security of user inputs. The form includes fields for name, email, phone number, and password, with comprehensive validation checks in place for each. The password validation is particularly robust, requiring a minimum length, uppercase and lowercase letters, a number, and a special character, ensuring a strong and secure password.

Real-time feedback enhances the user experience by highlighting errors as users type, providing instant guidance on how to correct any issues. Once all fields are properly validated, a success message is displayed, confirming the successful form submission.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases best practices for form validation, ensuring seamless user interaction and security. It is an invaluable resource for developers who want to implement robust validation and create intuitive, user-friendly forms for their web applications. Whether you're building sign-up forms or contact pages, this project serves as an ideal foundation for incorporating effective form handling into any website.
